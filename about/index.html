  <h1>About</h1>

  <section>
    <p>The Swarthmore College Computer Society (SCCS) is a student-run group 
    offering computing services, tools, toys, and information to the Swarthmore 
    College community. We have a computer lab and video room in Tarble, offer email 
    and web accounts to users and student groups, and periodically host workshops 
    on various topics in technology and computers. Our goal is not to mirror ITS, 
    but to complement and supplement widely available services by providing 
    resources that would otherwise be out of the reach of individuals.</p>

    <p>Our services include physical and electronic resources. For example, you can 
    hang out or work in the Media Lounge, watch movies or play games in the Video 
    Pit, and take photos or make movies with our cameras. Or, from the convenience 
    of anywhere in the world with the internet, you can make your own website, get 
    spam-free email, get l33t with a shell account, and make wikis, databases, and 
    mailing lists for your group.</p>
